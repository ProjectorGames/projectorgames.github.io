Started by DjArcas 2008 after years of writing games for fun, ProjectorGames started out writing multiplayer arcade style games. With 32 player sharing a big screen, visitors to our events can join in by simple grabbing a controller and starting to play.

Several years later we broke in to the world of console gaming with FortressCraft, one of the biggest indie hits ever to arrive on XBox.

Most recently we concentrate on releasing multliplatform games for Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS and Android, and working to continually improve these games as long as they prove popular.
